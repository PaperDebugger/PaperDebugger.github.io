&lt;p>This Notice applies to the websites at &lt;a href="https://www.paperdebugger.com">paperdebugger.com&lt;/a> and related services
(“PaperDebugger”).&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- PaperDebugger is operated by COMPANY, with
{companyRegistraionInfo} (“COMPANY” or “we”). -->
&lt;p>We respect your concerns about privacy and value our relationship with you. This
Notice explains what personal data we collect, how we may use and
manage it and the rights you may have in relation to such personal
data. When we refer to “personal data” in this Notice, we mean
information relating to an identified or identifiable individual that
we collect and use in connection with PaperDebugger; not aggregate or
other anonymised data or information we process on behalf of our
customers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-do-we-collect-and-use-personal-data" >
&lt;div>
&lt;a href="#how-do-we-collect-and-use-personal-data">
#
&lt;/a>
How do we collect and use personal data?
&lt;/div>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We collect personal data in the following ways:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>information you provide to us directly online.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, when you register to use PaperDebugger, complete one
of our web forms, subscribe to updates or make a support request,
we collect the personal data you provide, like your name, email
address and other basic contact details / professional
information. We will use this information to enable you to access
and use PaperDebugger or fulfil the request you&amp;rsquo;ve made and to
track and improve the quality of the services we provide, which
may involve asking you about your experience with PaperDebugger.
You may also provide us with additional information to access and
use particular features within PaperDebugger, such as to populate
your profile, which you may update within your account settings.
More occasional examples could include where you respond to a
survey, complete a support request or enter into a competition.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>information we collect from your use of PaperDebugger.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you use PaperDebugger, we may collect information about that
usage and other technical information, such as your IP address,
browser type and any referring website addresses. We may combine
this automatically collected log information with other
information we collect about you and use it to keep a record of
our interaction and to enable us to support, personalize and
improve PaperDebugger. We may also collect this type of
information using cookies and other similar technologies — please
see our cookie policy for further details.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>information you provide to us in person.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, when you visit one of our exhibition booths or attend one
of our events, you may provide us with your contact details. We
will use this information to answer your enquiries or provide
other information requested by you.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>information we collect from our other interactions / business
dealings.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, if you attend a webinar, contact us via social media
or otherwise interact with our business, including as a
representative of a current / prospective customer, supplier or
business partner, we may track and make a record of those
interactions, which may contain personal data. If you visit one of
our offices, this may be captured on CCTV and used for security
reasons; and photographs / videos may be taken at our events and
used for promotional purposes, details of which will be available
on request at the relevant site.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>information provided to us by other PaperDebugger users.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We may receive personal data (for example, your email address)
from other PaperDebugger users or customers, for example if they
have tried to share something with you or tried to refer
PaperDebugger to you.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>information we collect from third parties or publicly
available sources.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We may collect information you post online (e.g. social media)
about us, our products/services and/or our industry (including our
competitors), for market research and product improvement
purposes.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In all the above cases, where we have a relationship with you, we may
also use the personal data we collect to manage and keep a record of
that relationship and other business administration purposes you’d
reasonably expect and, subject always to your preferences, to provide
information we think may be of interest to you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In many of the above cases, we may also use the information collected
to create aggregate or other non-personal data to enable us to
benchmark and improve PaperDebugger and for other analytical /
research purposes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unless we specifically request it, you should not provide us with any
sensitive personal information. If you provide personal data to us
about someone else (such as one of your colleagues), please ensure
that you have their permission to do so and that they’re aware of the
contents of this Notice.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="#the-legal-basis-for-our-use-of-your-personal-data">
#
&lt;/a>
The legal basis for our use of your personal data
&lt;/div>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In order to comply with European data privacy laws, we are required to
set out the legal bases for our use of your personal data, which are
as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>where you have given us your explicit consent, which you can
withdraw at any time. For example, we rely on your consent to
fulfill specific requests you’ve made, such as to receive our blog
emails, or provide information you’ve opted-in to receive;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>where the processing is necessary for the performance of our
contract with you, or to enter into such a contract. For example,
if you register to use PaperDebugger, we will need to use your
details to set-up and administer your account;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>where the processing is necessary to comply with our legal
obligations; or&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the processing is in our legitimate interests, provided these
are not overridden by your individual rights. For example, we rely
on our legitimate interests:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>to retain personal data that’s associated with content
you’ve made public, so that personal information, associated
with that content can be preserved.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>to contact you when you’ve not previously given us your
consent to do so, such as to tell you about things that we
think might be of interest to you, or to ask for your feedback
or opinion on us or our products/services.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>to collect publicly available information, such as posts on
social media, for market research and product improvement
purposes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>to use CCTV on our premises for security reasons.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>to create aggregated or other non-personal data from your
personal data.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="who-we-share-your-personal-data-with" >
&lt;div>
&lt;a href="#who-we-share-your-personal-data-with">
#
&lt;/a>
Who we share your personal data with
&lt;/div>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We may share your personal data within our corporate group on a
confidential basis for our internal administrative, billing and other
business purposes, and to fulfill a request that you might have made.
We do not generally disclose or share personal data with third
parties, except where it’s necessary for legitimate business reasons,
such as:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>to the agents, advisers and service providers that assist us in
running / we use to administer our business; to the subcontractors and
service providers* we use to provide and support PaperDebugger,
including, for example, providers of hosting, security and
infrastructure and customer support platforms; if you express interest
in an initiative we’re involved in, to other participants in such
initiative; if required to enable the integration or use of third
party resources accessed or procured via / used on PaperDebugger; if
part of our business is sold to or integrated with another business,
to our advisers and any prospective purchasers (and their advisers);
in such circumstances for which you have given your consent; if
necessary for the performance of the contract we have with you or in
order to enforce any claims we are entitled to; if required by law or
ordered by a court; if you register for a webinar or other event, to
other attendees and co-organisers of that event; in the case of your
PaperDebugger profile, subject to your preferences (which you can
change at any time, subject to limits on managed accounts), or details
associated with content you’ve chosen to make public, to other users
of PaperDebugger; if someone else is paying for your account (for
example, the university to which you belong) or you join a group on
PaperDebugger, either by accepting an invitation to that group or by
confirming your affiliation to that group (for example, by confirming
your university email address), to administrators of that grouping
(for example university staff), who may have access to information
such as: your email address, profile information, and aggregate
statistics on usage; in the case of personal data you share in any
PaperDebugger community services you participate in (for example
blogs, forums, and wikis), to the public.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- We include appropriate confidentiality and security obligations in
our contracts with our service providers and only permit them to
process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance
with our instructions (not for their own purposes). Such service
providers include: {billingService} for billing, {customerService}
for customer relationship management, {productFeedbackService} for
product feedback, and may also include the third parties listed
here. -->
&lt;p>Note, where you are using PaperDebugger pursuant to an organization’s
subscription, that organization may have certain admin rights over
your account, including the ability to track your usage and, in the
case of managed accounts, the ability to close your account and
access, delete and/or share your stuff, including by re-assigning
projects; and we will act in accordance with any instructions they may
give in respect of such information (if any) they may provide to us
about you or which we may collect on their behalf (whose policies -
not this policy - will govern how the personal data we process on
their behalf is used).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="security" >

Security
&lt;/div>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We take appropriate technical and organizational security measures to
protect personal data from accidental or unlawful destruction,
accidental loss and unauthorized access, destruction, misuse,
modification or disclosure, including generally accepted standards
designed to protect personal data provided to us, both during
transmission and once it is received. Please see our security overview
for details.&lt;/p>

Retention of your personal data
&lt;/div>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We only keep your personal data for as long as it is necessary for the
purposes for which it was collected or as otherwise permitted by law,
after which it will be destroyed, erased or anonymised. For example,
if you are an PaperDebugger user, we will delete your account profile
if you close your account, but may however retain certain limited
personal data about you to record your association with content you’ve
made public, and as required to comply with applicable law.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- {/* ## International transfers
While we are based in the Singapore, parts of our operations and much of our product infrastructure is based elsewhere, including the United States. This means that in order to run our business and operate PaperDebugger, personal data may be transferred to the USA, as well as to other locations where our affiliates and service providers are based. Whenever we make such transfers, we will ensure an appropriate level of protection is afforded to your personal data, which in the case of personal data originating from the UK or the European Economic Area (“EEA”) shall involve implementing at least one of the following safeguards:
making sure the destination country has been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data;
by using model form contracts that have been officially declared to afford your personal data an appropriate protection;
relying on an alternative recognised compliance standard for the lawful transfer of personal data.
Please email us at privacy@overleaf.com if you would like more information about these safeguards.

&lt;p>These terms of service (the “&lt;strong>Terms&lt;/strong>”) govern your
access to and use of the website at
&lt;a href="https://www.paperdebugger.com">paperdebugger.com&lt;/a> (the &amp;ldquo;Site&amp;rdquo;) and the products
and services made available via or in connection with the Site,
including related apps and browser extensions (the “Services”)
provided by PaperDebugger Inc. (“we” or “our” or &amp;ldquo;PaperDebugger&amp;rdquo;), so
please carefully read them before using the Services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you
are using the Services on behalf of an organization, you are agreeing
to these Terms for that organization and promising that you have the
authority to bind that organization to these terms. In that case,
“you” and “your” will refer to that organization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By accessing or otherwise using any part of the Services, including to
register an account, you acknowledge your agreement to these Terms, in
consideration for the mutual promises and obligations contained herein
and to the exclusion (to the maximum extent permitted by applicable
law) of all other terms and/or conditions which you may purport to
apply, including under any purchase order or similar document, even if
they do not explicitly contradict.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You may use the Services only in compliance with these Terms. You may
use the Services only if you have the power to form a contract with us
and are not barred under any applicable laws from doing so, including
if you are too young to enter into a binding contract or because you
are based in a sanctioned country or are on a sanctions list. The
Services may continue to change over time as we refine and add more
features. We may stop, suspend, or modify the Services at any time
without prior notice to you (but recognising your work is important to
you, please read the note below on access to your files in these
circumstances). We may also remove any content from our Services at
our discretion.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="your-stuff--your-privacy" >
&lt;div>
&lt;a href="#your-stuff--your-privacy">
#
&lt;/a>
Your Stuff &amp;amp; Your Privacy
&lt;/div>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>By using our Services, you may create or provide us with information,
files, and folders via our products, services, and otherwise
(together, “your stuff”). We don’t claim any ownership of your stuff.
These Terms only grant us rights to use your stuff to fulfill a
request you&amp;rsquo;ve made and otherwise provide the Services, as explained
below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These include rights to store and reformat and to analyze for
aggregate reporting and analysis purposes, and will involve us making
choices in the way we technically administer our Services, for
example, how we redundantly backup data to keep it safe. These rights
extend to allow us to use our affiliates and trusted third parties to
provide the Services, for example Google Cloud Platform, which
provides our main storage space.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To be clear, aside from the rare exceptions we identify in our Privacy
Notice or as explained in the ‘Managed Accounts’ section, we won’t
share your stuff with others for any purpose unless you direct or have
authorized us to, including by choosing to connect your PaperDebugger
account to a third party app. YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IF YOU
HAVE A MANAGED ACCOUNT, THE MANAGER ORGANIZATION WILL HAVE CERTAIN
ADMIN RIGHTS OVER SUCH AN ACCOUNT AND ACCESS TO / CONTROL OVER YOUR
STUFF.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You are solely responsible for your conduct, the content of your
stuff, and your communications with others while using the Services.
For example, it’s your responsibility to ensure that you have the
rights or permission needed to comply with these Terms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We may choose to review public content for compliance with our
community guidelines, but you acknowledge that we have no obligation
to review or monitor any information on the Services. We are not
responsible for the accuracy, completeness, appropriateness, or
legality of your stuff, user posts, or any other information you
provide or may be able to access using the Services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although we reserve the right to stop, suspend, or modify the Services
at any time without prior notice to you, we recognise that your stuff
is important to you, and that you may wish to retrieve your stuff from
PaperDebugger in this event. In the case of individual accounts, we
will make reasonable effort to contact you in such circumstances, and
aim to keep your stuff available for retrieval from PaperDebugger in
read-only form for up to 3 months beyond the time of suspension (or
otherwise) of the Services. However, for other types of account such
as managed accounts (see ‘Managed Accounts’ section), your stuff may
not be directly retrievable by you.&lt;/p>

&lt;div>
&lt;a href="#sharing-your-stuff">
#
&lt;/a>
Sharing Your Stuff
&lt;/div>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Services provide features that allow you to share your stuff with
others (including third-party apps that you use to access your PaperDebugger account or that you connect your account with) or to
make it public. There are many things that may happen with your stuff
once it’s been shared or made public (for example, people may copy it,
modify it, re-share it). Please therefore consider carefully what you
choose to share or make public and that you have all necessary rights
and permissions to do so. We will not have any responsibility arising
from the sharing of your stuff.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="registering-with-us" >
&lt;div>
&lt;a href="#registering-with-us">
#
&lt;/a>
Registering with Us
&lt;/div>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When registering to use a Service you must choose a username and
password, unless you use a single sign-on (SSO) option where
supported. You are responsible for all actions taken under your chosen
username and password, even if you have not authorized them, which you
will keep private and not allow anyone else to use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You must ensure that the information you provide is accurate and
truthful, and to tell us promptly if it changes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You should immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your
account and update your user credentials if you suspect that they are
not secure. You acknowledge that if you wish to protect your
transmission of data or files to PaperDebugger, it is your
responsibility to use a secure encrypted connection to communicate
with the Services.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="managed-accounts" >
&lt;div>
&lt;a href="#managed-accounts">
#
&lt;/a>
Managed Accounts
&lt;/div>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If your account is a managed account, you are part of a managed PaperDebugger
subscription controlled by the owner of that subscription (the “&lt;b>Manager Organization&lt;/b>”), who
typically pays for it. We have entered into a separate contract to set
up the managed subscription, which contains our commitment to provide
the Services and look after your stuff (which we will owe to the
Manager Organization), so that you and others could join. Importantly,
the Manager Organization will have admin rights over your account and
control over your stuff. For example, the Manager Organization will be
able to close your account (managed users cannot do this themselves)
and access, delete and/or share your stuff, including by re-assigning
projects; and by joining a managed PaperDebugger subscription or using
a managed account, you give us all permissions as may be required for
us to act in accordance with their directions and requests in respect
of your PaperDebugger account and stuff. These permissions, which
cannot be revoked, give the Manager Organization ultimate control of
your account and stuff, which will be subject to any ownership or
other terms that you have agreed with the Owning Subscription. You
should review these terms and the Manager Organization’s policies
before joining a managed PaperDebugger subscription or using a managed

either reject your order and notify you of such rejection, or inform
you as soon as possible and give you the option of canceling your
order or reconfirming it at the correct price and/or description. If
we give you the option of canceling your order or reconfirming it at

Prices, Payments, Tax and Refunds
&lt;/div>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Though we’d much rather you stay, you can stop using our Services any
time. If you wish to downgrade or cancel a Service, you must do this
at least one full working day before the end of your payment period.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Prices included on the Site are illustrative only and are subject to
change at any time. Amounts are stated exclusive of VAT, sales tax and
other Taxes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you sign up for a free trial, we may require you to provide a valid
credit card or other payment method. We will charge you automatically
on the first day after the free trial is over, unless you cancel or
downgrade to a charge-free Service before the end of the free-trial
period.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you pay using a credit card or any digital payment method supported
by PaperDebugger, you authorize us to charge your account for the
Services using that payment method on a recurring basis, unless
otherwise specified. If you choose to pay via PayPal, we use “PayPal
Reference Transactions” for this purpose. If your payment details
cease to be valid or you notify us to stop using a previously
designated payment method and fail to designate an alternative, we may
immediately suspend use and access to the Services at the end of your
paid subscription.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you upgrade any Service, we will charge you the additional cost for
that upgrade in respect of the remainder of your (then current)
payment period and update your new payment period according to your
new subscription.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For certain paid-for Services, we may allow for individual licenses to
be purchased in bulk. If you make such a purchase, you&amp;rsquo;ll be free to
allocate these &amp;ldquo;premium&amp;rdquo; licenses as you see fit on a ‘named user
basis’ (this will upgrade those end users&amp;rsquo; free accounts). The
licenses will be valid for the 12 month period commencing on the date
on which you make the purchase (the “Bulk License Period”). While you
won&amp;rsquo;t - unless the licenses are part of a managed subscription (see
the ‘Managed Accounts’ section above) - have any privileged access
rights in respect of other end user accounts, even though you&amp;rsquo;ve paid
for them to have premium features, they&amp;rsquo;re linked on our systems -
this means you can withdraw the paid-for license rights you&amp;rsquo;ve
allocated to one account (so you might want to warn the account
holder!) and transfer them to another. You may also purchase
additional licenses at any time; however these will be chargeable at
the then-prevailing price (pro-rated if the purchase is made part way
through the Bulk License Period), which may be in excess of the
original price paid. All licenses will auto-renew for additional 12
month periods (each a “Renewal Period”) on an annual basis unless
canceled by you in your accounts settings or in writing not less than
thirty (30) days in advance of the date of renewal (or such shorter
period as we may allow).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will be responsible for payment of any Taxes in addition to our
price. If we are required to collect or pay Taxes, the Taxes will be
charged to you. This includes adding VAT or local sales taxes (where
applicable) at the checkout / to our invoice(s) at the appropriate
rate based on information you provide to us. Please note that we have
no control over these charges and cannot predict their amount. Please
contact your local customs office or taxation authority for further
information before placing your order. Any assessment we make,
including at the time of purchase, of the amount or applicability of
sales or other Taxes will rely on the information you have provided
and you agree to reimburse us on demand for any charges, and
additional costs or expenses, we might incur if such information is
not accurate and complete.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Where we refer to &amp;ldquo;Taxes&amp;rdquo;, we mean any duties, customs fees, levies or
taxes (other than income tax) associated with the purchase or use of
the Services, including any related penalties or interest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are an individual and are not happy with our Service, we will
offer a full refund if you give us written notice that you wish to
cancel within 30 days of payment. Otherwise, you will have no right to
a refund.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are entitled to a refund, we will notify you about your refund
via email within a reasonable period of time. We will usually process
a refund as soon as possible and, in any case, within 30 days of the
day we confirmed to you via email that you are entitled to a refund.
Refunds will usually be made by crediting the payment card or
electronic payment account you used to purchase the Services.&lt;/p>

Termination
&lt;/div>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Though we’d much rather you stay, you can stop using our Services any
time. If you wish to downgrade or cancel a Service, you must do this
at least one full working day before the end of your payment period
via your Account Settings, and the change will take effect at the end
of that payment period. Your ability to downgrade or cancel a Service
is limited for managed accounts - see the ‘Managed Accounts’ section
above.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unless otherwise agreed, we reserve the right to suspend or end the
Services at any time, with or without cause, and with or without
notice. For example, we may suspend or terminate your use if you are
not complying with these Terms, or use the Services in any way that
would cause us legal liability or disrupt others’ use of the Services.
If we suspend or terminate your use without cause, we will try to let
you (or in the case of a managed PaperDebugger subscription, the
Manager Organization) know in advance and help with the retrieval of
your stuff, though there may be some cases (for example, repeatedly or
flagrantly violating these Terms, a court order, or danger to other
users) where we may suspend immediately.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We reserve the right to suspend the provision of any part of the
Services, or terminate our agreement to provide Services to you for
non-payment or any deliberate or material breach, which will include
any breach of the PaperDebugger Acceptable Use Policy, fraudulent or
illegal activity or misuse of the Service, or if you fail to provide
us upon request with sufficient information to enable us to determine
the accuracy and validity of any information supplied by you, or your
identity.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If your subscription for a paid account expires (including where
payment has been made by someone else (e.g. an institution or other
organization that you belong to) and that payment ends), unless you
had a managed account, we’ll try to make sure your stuff continues to
be accessible via a “free” account, subject to compliance with the
respective terms and conditions. If you’ve exceeded the limits of the
free account, you will need to archive old content before being able
to add more content.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you don’t want to continue to have an account with us at all,
unless you have a managed account, you may close your account via your
Account Settings. We may retain and use your stuff as necessary to
comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our
agreements. Consistent with these requirements, we will try to delete
your stuff quickly but there might be latency in deletions from our
servers, and backed-up versions might persist. In addition, files that
you have in common with other users may be retained.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For managed accounts, the Manager Organization can close your account
at any time and access, delete and/or share your stuff, including by
re-assigning projects - see “Managed Accounts” section.&lt;/p>

regard to its conflict of law principles, except if you are resident

PaperDebugger shall have the right to bring an action in any court of

PaperDebugger&amp;rsquo;s failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its
right to do so later. If a provision is found unenforceable the
remaining provisions of the Agreement will remain in full effect and
an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as
closely as possible. Any reference to “includes” and “including” shall
mean including without limitation and general words shall not be given
a restrictive meaning by reason of the fact that they are followed by
particular examples intended to be embraced by the general words. You
may not assign any of your rights in these Terms, and any such attempt
