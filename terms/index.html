These terms of service (the “Terms”) govern your
access to and use of the website at
paperdebugger.com (the &ldquo;Site&rdquo;) and the products
and services made available via or in connection with the Site,
including related apps and browser extensions (the “Services”)
provided by PaperDebugger Inc. (“we” or “our” or &ldquo;PaperDebugger&rdquo;), so
please carefully read them before using the Services.
By using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you

authority to bind that organization to these terms. In that case,
“you” and “your” will refer to that organization."><link rel=icon type=image/x-icon href=https://www.paperdebugger.com/favicon.ico><link rel=apple-touch-icon-precomposed

access to and use of the website at
<a href=https://www.paperdebugger.com>paperdebugger.com</a> (the &ldquo;Site&rdquo;) and the products
and services made available via or in connection with the Site,
including related apps and browser extensions (the “Services”)
provided by PaperDebugger Inc. (“we” or “our” or &ldquo;PaperDebugger&rdquo;), so
please carefully read them before using the Services.</p><p>By using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you
are using the Services on behalf of an organization, you are agreeing
to these Terms for that organization and promising that you have the
authority to bind that organization to these terms. In that case,
“you” and “your” will refer to that organization.</p><p>By accessing or otherwise using any part of the Services, including to
register an account, you acknowledge your agreement to these Terms, in
consideration for the mutual promises and obligations contained herein
and to the exclusion (to the maximum extent permitted by applicable
law) of all other terms and/or conditions which you may purport to
apply, including under any purchase order or similar document, even if
they do not explicitly contradict.</p><p>You may use the Services only in compliance with these Terms. You may
use the Services only if you have the power to form a contract with us
and are not barred under any applicable laws from doing so, including
if you are too young to enter into a binding contract or because you
are based in a sanctioned country or are on a sanctions list. The
Services may continue to change over time as we refine and add more
features. We may stop, suspend, or modify the Services at any time
without prior notice to you (but recognising your work is important to
you, please read the note below on access to your files in these
circumstances). We may also remove any content from our Services at
our discretion.</p><h2 id=your-stuff--your-privacy><div><a href=#your-stuff--your-privacy>#
</a>Your Stuff & Your Privacy</div></h2><p>By using our Services, you may create or provide us with information,
files, and folders via our products, services, and otherwise
(together, “your stuff”). We don’t claim any ownership of your stuff.
These Terms only grant us rights to use your stuff to fulfill a
request you&rsquo;ve made and otherwise provide the Services, as explained
below.</p><p>These include rights to store and reformat and to analyze for
aggregate reporting and analysis purposes, and will involve us making
choices in the way we technically administer our Services, for
example, how we redundantly backup data to keep it safe. These rights
extend to allow us to use our affiliates and trusted third parties to
provide the Services, for example Google Cloud Platform, which
provides our main storage space.</p><p>To be clear, aside from the rare exceptions we identify in our Privacy
Notice or as explained in the ‘Managed Accounts’ section, we won’t
share your stuff with others for any purpose unless you direct or have
authorized us to, including by choosing to connect your PaperDebugger
account to a third party app. YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IF YOU
HAVE A MANAGED ACCOUNT, THE MANAGER ORGANIZATION WILL HAVE CERTAIN
ADMIN RIGHTS OVER SUCH AN ACCOUNT AND ACCESS TO / CONTROL OVER YOUR
STUFF.</p><p>You are solely responsible for your conduct, the content of your
stuff, and your communications with others while using the Services.
For example, it’s your responsibility to ensure that you have the
rights or permission needed to comply with these Terms.</p><p>We may choose to review public content for compliance with our
community guidelines, but you acknowledge that we have no obligation
to review or monitor any information on the Services. We are not
responsible for the accuracy, completeness, appropriateness, or
legality of your stuff, user posts, or any other information you
provide or may be able to access using the Services.</p><p>Although we reserve the right to stop, suspend, or modify the Services
at any time without prior notice to you, we recognise that your stuff
is important to you, and that you may wish to retrieve your stuff from
PaperDebugger in this event. In the case of individual accounts, we
will make reasonable effort to contact you in such circumstances, and
aim to keep your stuff available for retrieval from PaperDebugger in
read-only form for up to 3 months beyond the time of suspension (or
otherwise) of the Services. However, for other types of account such
as managed accounts (see ‘Managed Accounts’ section), your stuff may
not be directly retrievable by you.</p><h2 id=sharing-your-stuff><div><a href=#sharing-your-stuff>#
</a>Sharing Your Stuff</div></h2><p>The Services provide features that allow you to share your stuff with
others (including third-party apps that you use to access your PaperDebugger account or that you connect your account with) or to
make it public. There are many things that may happen with your stuff
once it’s been shared or made public (for example, people may copy it,
modify it, re-share it). Please therefore consider carefully what you
choose to share or make public and that you have all necessary rights
and permissions to do so. We will not have any responsibility arising
from the sharing of your stuff.</p><h2 id=registering-with-us><div><a href=#registering-with-us>#
</a>Registering with Us</div></h2><p>When registering to use a Service you must choose a username and
password, unless you use a single sign-on (SSO) option where
supported. You are responsible for all actions taken under your chosen
username and password, even if you have not authorized them, which you
will keep private and not allow anyone else to use.</p><p>You must ensure that the information you provide is accurate and
truthful, and to tell us promptly if it changes.</p><p>You should immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your
account and update your user credentials if you suspect that they are
not secure. You acknowledge that if you wish to protect your
transmission of data or files to PaperDebugger, it is your
responsibility to use a secure encrypted connection to communicate
with the Services.</p><h2 id=managed-accounts><div><a href=#managed-accounts>#
</a>Managed Accounts</div></h2><p>If your account is a managed account, you are part of a managed PaperDebugger
subscription controlled by the owner of that subscription (the “<b>Manager Organization</b>”), who
typically pays for it. We have entered into a separate contract to set
up the managed subscription, which contains our commitment to provide
the Services and look after your stuff (which we will owe to the
Manager Organization), so that you and others could join. Importantly,
the Manager Organization will have admin rights over your account and
control over your stuff. For example, the Manager Organization will be
able to close your account (managed users cannot do this themselves)
and access, delete and/or share your stuff, including by re-assigning
projects; and by joining a managed PaperDebugger subscription or using
a managed account, you give us all permissions as may be required for
us to act in accordance with their directions and requests in respect
of your PaperDebugger account and stuff. These permissions, which
cannot be revoked, give the Manager Organization ultimate control of
your account and stuff, which will be subject to any ownership or
other terms that you have agreed with the Owning Subscription. You
should review these terms and the Manager Organization’s policies
before joining a managed PaperDebugger subscription or using a managed
account, as, for example, they may explain who owns content you create
using a managed account, and how the Manager Organization will use it.</p><p>You cannot change from a managed to an unmanaged account. Therefore,
it is important that you consider whether a managed account is right
for you before you register for one or agree to transfer an existing
unmanaged account to a managed account.</p><h2 id=paperdebugger-ai><div><a href=#paperdebugger-ai>#
</a>PaperDebugger AI</div></h2><p>“Input” means an input you enter into the PaperDebugger AI Tool; and
“Output” means an output generated and returned to you by the
PaperDebugger AI Tool based on your Input.</p><p>Inputs and Outputs will be treated by us as your Stuff under these
Terms. <b>We will not use your Inputs to train models without your consent</b>
, and as between you and us, you retain ownership of the Inputs and
shall own Outputs, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Due to
the nature of the PaperDebugger and artificial intelligence generally,
Outputs are provided “AS-IS” and may not be unique, meaning other
users may receive similar outputs from the PaperDebugger. You are
solely responsible for all use of the Outputs, which you should always
check, including for accuracy, completeness and suitability.</p><h2 id=our-rights><div><a href=#our-rights>#
</a>Our Rights</div></h2><p>The Service is owned by or licensed to PaperDebugger and/or its
affiliates, and is protected by copyrights, trademarks, service marks,
patents, trade secrets and/or other industrial and proprietary rights
and laws, including international conventions and treaties
(“Proprietary Rights”).</p><p>Nothing in
these Terms shall operate to transfer any Proprietary Rights in any
part of the Service, to grant any rights to use the name “
PaperDebugger” or our other trademarks or to give rise to any implied
rights.</p><p>You agree not to remove, suppress or modify in any way the proprietary
markings, including any trademark or copyright notice, used in
relation to part of the Service.</p><p>Unless otherwise agreed in a Contract, the Service is provided for
your own non-commercial, internal and personal use, at all times
subject to these Terms. For paid subscriptions (excluding personal or
student plans), you may also use the Service for your own internal
business purposes (which, for the avoidance of doubt, would not
include the right to re-sell or commercialize access). You shall not
otherwise use any part of the Service without our prior and express
written agreement.</p><p>If you are an organization, unless requested in writing otherwise, we
may publicly refer to you as a customer, including on our website(s)
and presentational material, provided such reference accurately
reflects the nature of our relationship and that any use of your trade
marks is in accordance with your reasonable guidelines given as to the
form and manner of their use.</p><h2 id=your-responsibilities><div><a href=#your-responsibilities>#
</a>Your Responsibilities</div></h2><p>You must comply with all laws and regulations applicable to you and
the use of the Services.</p><p>Files and other content in the Services you receive or share may be
protected by intellectual property rights of others. You agree to
always respect the proprietary rights of others and must never copy,
upload, download, or share files unless you have the rights and
permissions to do so. You, not PaperDebugger, will be fully
responsible and liable for what you copy, share, upload, download,
receive or otherwise use while using the Services. If you require use
of files (including font files) that are accessible within
PaperDebugger’s compiler system, but owned by a third party, you must
first ensure you have the permission of the owner.</p><p>You are responsible for maintaining and protecting all of your stuff,
and should always make sure to keep a local copy. We will not be
liable for any loss or corruption of your stuff, or for any costs or
expenses associated with backing up or restoring it.</p><h2 id=beta-services><div><a href=#beta-services>#
</a>Beta Services</div></h2><p>From time to time, we may make available Beta Services. Beta Services
may not always perform as expected and may be changed or withdrawn at
any time without notice. Any use of Beta Services, which are provided
“AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE”, is solely at your own risk, and may be
subject to additional requirements specified by us and include
features that are of a confidential nature. You agree not to make
public statements relating to any Beta Service without our prior
written approval, and specifically acknowledge that any feedback you
provide in relation to any Beta Service, and data collected from their
use, may be used to help us develop and improve our products,
notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms.</p><p>All Beta Services shall be considered as being made available subject
to these Terms, to the exclusion of all other terms and conditions,
including those of any Contract - even where a Beta Service is an
additional feature or module to a Service provided as part of a
Contract - unless the Beta Service is specifically identified in the
Contract as being provided pursuant thereto.</p><p>The term “Beta Service” includes any service or feature that is
identified, including via the applicable user interface or other
communication from us, as “Beta”, “Prototype”, “Limited Release”,
“Early Release” or similar, or provided as part of &ldquo;PaperDebugger Labs&rdquo;.</p><h2 id=your-feedback><div><a href=#your-feedback>#
</a>Your Feedback</div></h2><p>While we appreciate it when users provide us or post in our forums
feedback, suggestions or other comments, please be aware that we may
use, edit and disclose these without any obligation to you. By
providing such comments, you irrevocably grant all rights necessary
for their use for product improvement purposes and otherwise as we may
choose.</p><p>You are responsible for ensuring that any comments you make do not
contain any material that could be considered offensive, false,
defamatory or unlawful or violates any Proprietary Rights or other
rights.</p><h2 id=acceptable-use-policy><div><a href=#acceptable-use-policy>#
</a>Acceptable Use Policy</div></h2><p>You will not, and will not attempt to, misuse the Services, and will
use the Services only in a manner consistent with the PaperDebugger
Acceptable Use Policy.</p><h2 id=links-to-or-from-the-service><div><a href=#links-to-or-from-the-service>#
</a>Links to or from the Service</div></h2><p>The Services may contain links to third-party websites or resources.
We do not endorse and are not responsible or liable for such resources
in any way, including their availability, accuracy, nor for any
related content, products, or services. You accept sole responsibility
for your use of any such websites or resources. If you want to link to
any part of the Service, you must ask our permission first, and only
do so for non-commercial purposes and in a way that is fair and legal
and does not damage our reputation or take advantage of it.</p><h2 id=order-process-and-formation-of-a-contract><div><a href=#order-process-and-formation-of-a-contract>#
</a>Order Process and Formation of a Contract</div></h2><p>If you are paying for a Service, a contract to provide that Service
will only arise upon receipt of payment in cleared funds and once we
have made the Service available to you.</p><p>Whilst we try and ensure that all the information on the Site is
accurate, errors may occur. In the unlikely event that such
information, including any price and/or description of an item listed
on the Site has been incorrectly advertised, we will not be under any
obligation to sell or provide those Services to you. If we discover
the error before a Contract is formed we will at our discretion,
either reject your order and notify you of such rejection, or inform
you as soon as possible and give you the option of canceling your
order or reconfirming it at the correct price and/or description. If
we give you the option of canceling your order or reconfirming it at
the correct price and/or description but either cannot contact you or
do not receive your response within 14 days of sending you
notification (whether or not you receive it), we will reject your
order.</p><h2 id=prices-payments-tax-and-refunds><div><a href=#prices-payments-tax-and-refunds>#
</a>Prices, Payments, Tax and Refunds</div></h2><p>Though we’d much rather you stay, you can stop using our Services any
time. If you wish to downgrade or cancel a Service, you must do this
at least one full working day before the end of your payment period.</p><p>Prices included on the Site are illustrative only and are subject to
change at any time. Amounts are stated exclusive of VAT, sales tax and
other Taxes.</p><p>If you sign up for a free trial, we may require you to provide a valid
credit card or other payment method. We will charge you automatically
on the first day after the free trial is over, unless you cancel or
downgrade to a charge-free Service before the end of the free-trial
period.</p><p>If you pay using a credit card or any digital payment method supported
by PaperDebugger, you authorize us to charge your account for the
Services using that payment method on a recurring basis, unless
otherwise specified. If you choose to pay via PayPal, we use “PayPal
Reference Transactions” for this purpose. If your payment details
cease to be valid or you notify us to stop using a previously
designated payment method and fail to designate an alternative, we may
immediately suspend use and access to the Services at the end of your
paid subscription.</p><p>If you upgrade any Service, we will charge you the additional cost for
that upgrade in respect of the remainder of your (then current)
payment period and update your new payment period according to your
new subscription.</p><p>For certain paid-for Services, we may allow for individual licenses to
be purchased in bulk. If you make such a purchase, you&rsquo;ll be free to
allocate these &ldquo;premium&rdquo; licenses as you see fit on a ‘named user
basis’ (this will upgrade those end users&rsquo; free accounts). The
licenses will be valid for the 12 month period commencing on the date
on which you make the purchase (the “Bulk License Period”). While you
won&rsquo;t - unless the licenses are part of a managed subscription (see
the ‘Managed Accounts’ section above) - have any privileged access
rights in respect of other end user accounts, even though you&rsquo;ve paid
for them to have premium features, they&rsquo;re linked on our systems -
this means you can withdraw the paid-for license rights you&rsquo;ve
allocated to one account (so you might want to warn the account
holder!) and transfer them to another. You may also purchase
additional licenses at any time; however these will be chargeable at
the then-prevailing price (pro-rated if the purchase is made part way
through the Bulk License Period), which may be in excess of the
original price paid. All licenses will auto-renew for additional 12
month periods (each a “Renewal Period”) on an annual basis unless
canceled by you in your accounts settings or in writing not less than
thirty (30) days in advance of the date of renewal (or such shorter
period as we may allow).</p><p>You will be responsible for payment of any Taxes in addition to our
price. If we are required to collect or pay Taxes, the Taxes will be
charged to you. This includes adding VAT or local sales taxes (where
applicable) at the checkout / to our invoice(s) at the appropriate
rate based on information you provide to us. Please note that we have
no control over these charges and cannot predict their amount. Please
contact your local customs office or taxation authority for further
information before placing your order. Any assessment we make,
including at the time of purchase, of the amount or applicability of
sales or other Taxes will rely on the information you have provided
and you agree to reimburse us on demand for any charges, and
additional costs or expenses, we might incur if such information is
not accurate and complete.</p><p>Where we refer to &ldquo;Taxes&rdquo;, we mean any duties, customs fees, levies or
taxes (other than income tax) associated with the purchase or use of
the Services, including any related penalties or interest.</p><p>If you are an individual and are not happy with our Service, we will
offer a full refund if you give us written notice that you wish to
cancel within 30 days of payment. Otherwise, you will have no right to
a refund.</p><p>If you are entitled to a refund, we will notify you about your refund
via email within a reasonable period of time. We will usually process
a refund as soon as possible and, in any case, within 30 days of the
day we confirmed to you via email that you are entitled to a refund.
Refunds will usually be made by crediting the payment card or
electronic payment account you used to purchase the Services.</p><h2 id=termination><div><a href=#termination>#
</a>Termination</div></h2><p>Though we’d much rather you stay, you can stop using our Services any
time. If you wish to downgrade or cancel a Service, you must do this
at least one full working day before the end of your payment period
via your Account Settings, and the change will take effect at the end
of that payment period. Your ability to downgrade or cancel a Service
is limited for managed accounts - see the ‘Managed Accounts’ section
above.</p><p>Unless otherwise agreed, we reserve the right to suspend or end the
Services at any time, with or without cause, and with or without
notice. For example, we may suspend or terminate your use if you are
not complying with these Terms, or use the Services in any way that
would cause us legal liability or disrupt others’ use of the Services.
If we suspend or terminate your use without cause, we will try to let
you (or in the case of a managed PaperDebugger subscription, the
Manager Organization) know in advance and help with the retrieval of
your stuff, though there may be some cases (for example, repeatedly or
flagrantly violating these Terms, a court order, or danger to other
users) where we may suspend immediately.</p><p>We reserve the right to suspend the provision of any part of the
Services, or terminate our agreement to provide Services to you for
non-payment or any deliberate or material breach, which will include
any breach of the PaperDebugger Acceptable Use Policy, fraudulent or
illegal activity or misuse of the Service, or if you fail to provide
us upon request with sufficient information to enable us to determine
the accuracy and validity of any information supplied by you, or your
identity.</p><p>This clause does not affect your statutory rights as a consumer.</p><h2 id=use-post-termination><div><a href=#use-post-termination>#
</a>Use post-termination</div></h2><p>If your subscription for a paid account expires (including where
payment has been made by someone else (e.g. an institution or other
organization that you belong to) and that payment ends), unless you
had a managed account, we’ll try to make sure your stuff continues to
be accessible via a “free” account, subject to compliance with the
respective terms and conditions. If you’ve exceeded the limits of the
free account, you will need to archive old content before being able
to add more content.</p><p>If you don’t want to continue to have an account with us at all,
unless you have a managed account, you may close your account via your
Account Settings. We may retain and use your stuff as necessary to
comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our
agreements. Consistent with these requirements, we will try to delete
your stuff quickly but there might be latency in deletions from our
servers, and backed-up versions might persist. In addition, files that
you have in common with other users may be retained.</p><p>For managed accounts, the Manager Organization can close your account
at any time and access, delete and/or share your stuff, including by
re-assigning projects - see “Managed Accounts” section.</p><h2 id=paperdebugger-is-provided-as-is><div><a href=#paperdebugger-is-provided-as-is>#
</a>PaperDebugger is provided “AS-IS”</div></h2><p>THOUGH WE WANT TO PROVIDE A GREAT SERVICE, WE CAN’T PROMISE THAT ALL
PARTS OF THE SERVICE WILL BE FREE FROM ERRORS AND BUGS OR SECURE AT
ALL TIMES. AS SUCH, THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS
AVAILABLE”, AT YOUR OWN RISK, WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY
OR OTHER WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND. WITHOUT LIMITING THE
FOREGOING, WE DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, FREEDOM FROM ERRORS AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. (We
are not shouting — it’s just that these disclaimers are really
important, so we want to highlight them.) Neither PaperDebugger nor
its affiliates will have any responsibility for any harm to your
computer system, loss or corruption of data, or other harm that
results from your access to or use of the Services. Some US states do
not allow the types of disclaimers in this paragraph, so they may not
apply to you.</p><h2 id=limitation-of-liability><div><a href=#limitation-of-liability>#
</a>Limitation of Liability</div></h2><p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
PAPERDEBUGGER, ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES,
AGENTS, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES,
REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT PAPERDEBUGGER
HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND EVEN IF A
REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE; (B) ANY LOSS OF PROFITS,
REVENUE, BUSINESS OR SAVINGS, DEPLETION OF GOODWILL AND/OR SIMILAR
LOSSES, OR LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF DATA; OR (C) IN RESPECT OF ANY CLAIMS
RELATING TO THE SERVICES, AN AMOUNT IN AGGREGATE THAT IS MORE THAN THE
GREATER OF £0.01 OR THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO
PAPERDEBUGGER FOR THE PAST THREE MONTHS OF THE SERVICES
IN QUESTION. SOME US STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE TYPES OF LIMITATIONS IN
THIS PARAGRAPH, SO THEY MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p><p>Notwithstanding any other provision in these Terms, nothing will
affect or limit your statutory rights; or will exclude or limit our
liability to the extent not permitted by applicable laws or
regulations.</p><p>You agree to fully indemnify, defend and hold PaperDebugger, and its
affiliates, officers, employees, agents, suppliers and licensors,
harmless on demand, from and against all claims, including losses
(including loss of profit, revenue, goodwill or reputation), costs and
expenses, including reasonable administrative and legal costs, arising
out of any breach of these Terms by you.</p><h2 id=separate-contract-and-additional-terms><div><a href=#separate-contract-and-additional-terms>#
</a>Separate Contract and Additional Terms</div></h2><p>If you are accessing and/or otherwise using the Service pursuant to a
separate agreement between the organization that you belong to or are
acting for (“Contract”), your use will also be subject to the
Contract, provided to the extent there is any conflict, the terms of
the Contract shall prevail. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in
these Terms shall impose additional obligations on that organization.</p><p>Usage restrictions and other additional terms and conditions
(“Additional Terms”) may apply to certain parts of the Service and
shall form part of these Terms. If we provide you with any software
under an open source license, these may include the terms of those
licenses. You shall comply with all Additional Terms referenced on any
part of the Service you use, posted to the Site or otherwise that you
are given notice of, and to the extent there is any conflict between
the Additional Terms and other parts of these Terms, the Additional
Terms shall prevail in respect of the relevant part of the Service.</p><h2 id=change-to-these-terms><div><a href=#change-to-these-terms>#
</a>Change to these Terms</div></h2><p>We may revise these Terms from time to time and the most current
version will always be posted on our website. If a revision, in our
sole discretion, is material we will notify you (for example via email
to the email address associated with your account). Other changes may
be posted to our news or terms page, so please check those pages
regularly. By continuing to access or use the Services after revisions
become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms. If you
do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Services.</p><h2 id=us-government-users><div><a href=#us-government-users>#
</a>US Government Users</div></h2><p>The Service is deemed to be “commercial computer software” /
“commercial computer software documentation” and other commercial
items including “technical data of a “commercial item”. If any U.S.
Government user requires rights beyond those expressly granted in
these Terms, or has other requirements not met by these Terms / the
Service, it should immediately discontinue use of the Service.</p><h2 id=miscellaneous-legal-terms><div><a href=#miscellaneous-legal-terms>#
</a>Miscellaneous Legal Terms</div></h2><p>These Terms, and any dispute, claim or proceedings of whatever nature
arising out of, or in any way relating to, these Terms will be
governed by and construed in accordance with English law, without
regard to its conflict of law principles, except if you are resident
(as determined by the most recent information about yourself provided
to PaperDebugger prior to the cause of action) in the United States,
in which case the laws of the State of New York, shall apply. Both
parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts,
except if you are a resident in the United States in which case action
may be brought in any federal or state court located in the County of
New York, State of New York. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
PaperDebugger shall have the right to bring an action in any court of
proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable relief.</p><p>These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive agreement between you
and PaperDebugger with respect to the Services, and supersede and
replace any other agreements, terms and conditions applicable to the
Services. These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights.
PaperDebugger&rsquo;s failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its
right to do so later. If a provision is found unenforceable the
remaining provisions of the Agreement will remain in full effect and
an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as
closely as possible. Any reference to “includes” and “including” shall
mean including without limitation and general words shall not be given
a restrictive meaning by reason of the fact that they are followed by
particular examples intended to be embraced by the general words. You
may not assign any of your rights in these Terms, and any such attempt
is void, but PaperDebugger may assign its rights to any of its
affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any
business associated with the Services. PaperDebugger and you are not
legal partners or agents; instead, our relationship is that of
independent contractors.</p><h2 id=force-majeure><div><a href=#force-majeure>#
</a>Force Majeure</div></h2><p>We shall have no liability for delays or failures in delivery or
performance of our obligations to you resulting from any act, events,
omissions, failures or accidents that are outside of our control
including: late, defective performance or non-performance by suppliers
and private or public telecommunication, computer network failures or
breakdown of equipment. If a delay is caused, we will be entitled to a
reasonable extension of time for performing its obligations. If the
period of delay or non-performance continues for 15 days, either party
may terminate by written notice.</p><h2 id=notices><div><a href=#notices>#
</a>Notices</div></h2><p>Any notice required to be given under these Terms must be in writing

the other party at the contact address provided (subject in the case
of any notice to be sent to PaperDebugger in respect of any legal
proceedings, to a copy also being sent by hand or registered mail and
marked for the attention of the Legal Department to its registered
address) and shall be deemed to have been duly given or made, if
delivered by hand, upon delivery, if sent by registered mail, on the
recorded date of receipt, or if sent by e-mail when actually received
