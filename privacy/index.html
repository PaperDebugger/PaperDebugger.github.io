Notice explains what personal data we collect, how we may use and
manage it and the rights you may have in relation to such personal
data. When we refer to “personal data” in this Notice, we mean
information relating to an identified or identifiable individual that
we collect and use in connection with PaperDebugger; not aggregate or

customers.</p><h2 id=how-do-we-collect-and-use-personal-data><div><a href=#how-do-we-collect-and-use-personal-data>#
</a>How do we collect and use personal data?</div></h2><p>We collect personal data in the following ways:</p><ul><li><p><strong>information you provide to us directly online.</strong></p><p>For example, when you register to use PaperDebugger, complete one
of our web forms, subscribe to updates or make a support request,
we collect the personal data you provide, like your name, email
address and other basic contact details / professional
information. We will use this information to enable you to access
and use PaperDebugger or fulfil the request you&rsquo;ve made and to
track and improve the quality of the services we provide, which
may involve asking you about your experience with PaperDebugger.
You may also provide us with additional information to access and
use particular features within PaperDebugger, such as to populate
your profile, which you may update within your account settings.
More occasional examples could include where you respond to a
survey, complete a support request or enter into a competition.</p></li><li><p><strong>information we collect from your use of PaperDebugger.</strong></p><p>When you use PaperDebugger, we may collect information about that
usage and other technical information, such as your IP address,
browser type and any referring website addresses. We may combine
this automatically collected log information with other
information we collect about you and use it to keep a record of
our interaction and to enable us to support, personalize and
improve PaperDebugger. We may also collect this type of
information using cookies and other similar technologies — please
see our cookie policy for further details.</p></li><li><p><strong>information you provide to us in person.</strong></p><p>For example, when you visit one of our exhibition booths or attend one
of our events, you may provide us with your contact details. We
will use this information to answer your enquiries or provide
other information requested by you.</p></li><li><p><strong>information we collect from our other interactions / business
dealings.</strong></p><p>For example, if you attend a webinar, contact us via social media
or otherwise interact with our business, including as a
representative of a current / prospective customer, supplier or
business partner, we may track and make a record of those
interactions, which may contain personal data. If you visit one of
our offices, this may be captured on CCTV and used for security
reasons; and photographs / videos may be taken at our events and
used for promotional purposes, details of which will be available
on request at the relevant site.</p></li><li><p><strong>information provided to us by other PaperDebugger users.</strong></p><p>We may receive personal data (for example, your email address)
from other PaperDebugger users or customers, for example if they
have tried to share something with you or tried to refer
PaperDebugger to you.</p></li><li><p><strong>information we collect from third parties or publicly
available sources.</strong></p><p>We may collect information you post online (e.g. social media)
about us, our products/services and/or our industry (including our
competitors), for market research and product improvement
purposes.</p></li></ul><p>In all the above cases, where we have a relationship with you, we may
also use the personal data we collect to manage and keep a record of
that relationship and other business administration purposes you’d
reasonably expect and, subject always to your preferences, to provide
information we think may be of interest to you.</p><p>In many of the above cases, we may also use the information collected
to create aggregate or other non-personal data to enable us to
benchmark and improve PaperDebugger and for other analytical /
research purposes.</p><p>Unless we specifically request it, you should not provide us with any
sensitive personal information. If you provide personal data to us
about someone else (such as one of your colleagues), please ensure
that you have their permission to do so and that they’re aware of the
contents of this Notice.</p><h2 id=the-legal-basis-for-our-use-of-your-personal-data><div><a href=#the-legal-basis-for-our-use-of-your-personal-data>#
</a>The legal basis for our use of your personal data</div></h2><p>In order to comply with European data privacy laws, we are required to
set out the legal bases for our use of your personal data, which are
as follows:</p><ul><li>where you have given us your explicit consent, which you can
withdraw at any time. For example, we rely on your consent to
fulfill specific requests you’ve made, such as to receive our blog
emails, or provide information you’ve opted-in to receive;</li><li>where the processing is necessary for the performance of our
contract with you, or to enter into such a contract. For example,
if you register to use PaperDebugger, we will need to use your
details to set-up and administer your account;</li><li>where the processing is necessary to comply with our legal
obligations; or</li><li>the processing is in our legitimate interests, provided these
are not overridden by your individual rights. For example, we rely
on our legitimate interests:<ul><li>to retain personal data that’s associated with content
you’ve made public, so that personal information, associated
with that content can be preserved.</li><li>to contact you when you’ve not previously given us your
consent to do so, such as to tell you about things that we
think might be of interest to you, or to ask for your feedback
or opinion on us or our products/services.</li><li>to collect publicly available information, such as posts on
social media, for market research and product improvement
purposes.</li><li>to use CCTV on our premises for security reasons.</li><li>to create aggregated or other non-personal data from your
personal data.</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=who-we-share-your-personal-data-with><div><a href=#who-we-share-your-personal-data-with>#
</a>Who we share your personal data with</div></h2><p>We may share your personal data within our corporate group on a
confidential basis for our internal administrative, billing and other
business purposes, and to fulfill a request that you might have made.
We do not generally disclose or share personal data with third
parties, except where it’s necessary for legitimate business reasons,
such as:</p><p>to the agents, advisers and service providers that assist us in
running / we use to administer our business; to the subcontractors and
service providers* we use to provide and support PaperDebugger,
including, for example, providers of hosting, security and
infrastructure and customer support platforms; if you express interest
in an initiative we’re involved in, to other participants in such
initiative; if required to enable the integration or use of third
party resources accessed or procured via / used on PaperDebugger; if
part of our business is sold to or integrated with another business,
to our advisers and any prospective purchasers (and their advisers);
in such circumstances for which you have given your consent; if
necessary for the performance of the contract we have with you or in
order to enforce any claims we are entitled to; if required by law or
ordered by a court; if you register for a webinar or other event, to
other attendees and co-organisers of that event; in the case of your
PaperDebugger profile, subject to your preferences (which you can
change at any time, subject to limits on managed accounts), or details
associated with content you’ve chosen to make public, to other users
of PaperDebugger; if someone else is paying for your account (for
example, the university to which you belong) or you join a group on
PaperDebugger, either by accepting an invitation to that group or by
confirming your affiliation to that group (for example, by confirming
your university email address), to administrators of that grouping
(for example university staff), who may have access to information
such as: your email address, profile information, and aggregate
statistics on usage; in the case of personal data you share in any
PaperDebugger community services you participate in (for example
blogs, forums, and wikis), to the public.</p><p>Note, where you are using PaperDebugger pursuant to an organization’s
subscription, that organization may have certain admin rights over
your account, including the ability to track your usage and, in the
case of managed accounts, the ability to close your account and
access, delete and/or share your stuff, including by re-assigning
projects; and we will act in accordance with any instructions they may
give in respect of such information (if any) they may provide to us
about you or which we may collect on their behalf (whose policies -
not this policy - will govern how the personal data we process on
their behalf is used).</p><h2 id=security><div><a href=#security>#
</a>Security</div></h2><p>We take appropriate technical and organizational security measures to
protect personal data from accidental or unlawful destruction,
accidental loss and unauthorized access, destruction, misuse,
modification or disclosure, including generally accepted standards
designed to protect personal data provided to us, both during
transmission and once it is received. Please see our security overview
for details.</p><h2 id=retention-of-your-personal-data><div><a href=#retention-of-your-personal-data>#
</a>Retention of your personal data</div></h2><p>We only keep your personal data for as long as it is necessary for the
purposes for which it was collected or as otherwise permitted by law,
after which it will be destroyed, erased or anonymised. For example,
if you are an PaperDebugger user, we will delete your account profile
if you close your account, but may however retain certain limited
personal data about you to record your association with content you’ve
made public, and as required to comply with applicable law.</p><h2 id=marketing><div><a href=#marketing>#

think might be of interest to you. Some of these messages may be

activity), public profile and posts (e.g. on social media), use of our
products/services and other information we may hold.</p><p>If you no longer wish to receive such communications, you can click
the unsubscribe button. Note, even if you unsubscribe from marketing
messages, we may still send you emails about the services you use,
